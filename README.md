# MonoChromatic

A WordPress theme that was created and designed by Jamie Jones for her blog http://jaymee.blog - Jaymee [Jaymee.blog] (http://jaymee.blog) . This theme is version 2.0 and is entitled Monochromatic Colors. Please respect my work, and please give credit where it is due if you have used any snippets of code you may find in my theme. Even though I have over a decade of building, coding, creating, and designing websites and the same goes for blogging, I am still learning new tricks and applying what I have learned to my themes. If anyone has any suggestions on what could be improved on this theme, please let me know!

Monochromatic is a WordPress theme that was created and designed by Jamie Jones for her blog. Quite a few years ago, and before all the recent changes or updates that have been made to WordPress, I once upon a time used the set featured image in my posts. Since updating my functions.php file, I haven't been able to use the set feature image function, as I have forgotten how to incorporate that particular function into my themes. It seemed all was lost until I stumbled upon a plugin called snippet code or short hand code for WordPress that allowed me to add the function/reference to use the set feature image filter again. As you can see, the comments have been completely removed due to personal reasons - even though the comments file is still located in the theme itself. With that said, I hope you enjoy the new theme and if you have any suggestions and/or comments to help me improve my themes, please by all means let me know! Knowing is half the battle!
