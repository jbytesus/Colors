I appreciate any suggestions anyone might have to better this theme or to help me learn new tricks to make WordPress themes load faster and less bloated and what I want it to do for myself.

Monochromatic is a WordPress theme that was created and designed by Jamie Jones for her blog. Quite a few years ago, and before all the recent changes or updates that have been made to WordPress, I once upon a time used the set featured image in my posts. Since updating my functions.php file, I haven't been able to use the set feature image function, as I have forgotten how to incorporate that particular function into my themes. It seemed all was lost until I stumbled upon a plugin called snippet code or short hand code for WordPress that allowed me to add the function/reference to use the set feature image filter again. As you can see, the comments have been completely removed due to personal reasons - even though the comments file is still located in the theme itself. With that said, I hope you enjoy the new theme and if you have any suggestions and/or comments to help me improve my themes, please by all means let me know! Knowing is half the battle!
